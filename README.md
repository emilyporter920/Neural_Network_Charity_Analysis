# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

* Using machine learning (Deep Neural Networks) to assess if funding from Alphabet Soup would help applicants succeed

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

* The variable "IS_SUCCESSFUL" was the target for this model
* The features "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT" were considered for this model
* The categorical columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed from the dataset because they were not target or features

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* There are two neural hidden layers. The first layer has 80 neurons and the second layer has 30 neurons. The activation of the first layer is "relu" and the activation of the second layer is "sigmoid"
* An accuracy of 75% was not reached and the model accuracy stayed at approximately 73% after extensive testing.
